### Overview

The purpose of this lesson is familiarize students with the basics of Python.

`Activities: 6`

##### Learning Objectives

* Installation of Python & Django

* Given an installation of Python 3.5.x, students should be able to:

  * Declare and manipulate variables that take advantage of Python's "duck typing";

  * Instantiate and populate lists and dictionaries;

  * Use Python's basic conditional control structures to implement branching behavior; and

  * Use Python's OO features to define classes and instantiate objects.
  
  
####  Notes

* This lesson provides cursory coverage of the language, and entails numerous omissions of essential concepts. These omissions are known and intentional. The point is that students should get enough to continue to experiment with the language. This will _not_ be "most of the language". This is fine.
